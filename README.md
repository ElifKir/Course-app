# Course-app
Course app with JS


How to use?
As desired, the course title, instructor and the file name of the photo are entered and the save button is clicked.

Then the entered information and the photo appear on the screen. 

When the information is entered and the save button is pressed, the text "the course has been added" appears in the green box.

If the save button is pressed without adding any information, the warning "Please complete the form" appears on the screen in the yellow box.

In addition, you can delete the information you want to delete by pressing the "delete" button on the left, and then continue to add information.

You can enter as much information as you want. I put the photos in the "img" folder, you can access them from there. If you write the file name of the photo properly, the application will work.
